# Next Themes License

This repository contains a copy of the "next-themes" library license. We have copied their open-source code in order to create two separate themes: one for the color mode and one for the dark mode.

Please note that the original "next-themes" library is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes/blob/main/LICENSE). We have included the license file in this repository for reference.

For more information about the "next-themes" library, please visit their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).
